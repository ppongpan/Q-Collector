# Complete Deletion System v0.7.29 - Implementation Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ BACKEND COMPLETE - Ready for API Routes & Frontend Integration

## Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive deletion system with:
1. ✅ MinIO file deletion for all submissions
2. ✅ Dynamic table deletion with audit logging
3. ✅ Table deletion history tracking

---

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Database Foundation
**File:** `backend/migrations/20250116000000-create-table-deletion-logs.js`
- Created migration for `table_deletion_logs` table
- 17 columns including metadata, backup info, audit trail
- 6 indexes for efficient querying

**File:** `backend/models/TableDeletionLog.js`
- Model with static methods:
  - `logDeletion()` - Create deletion log
  - `getFormDeletionHistory()` - Get history by form
  - `getUserDeletionHistory()` - Get history by user

**Verification:**
```bash
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
node backend/scripts/verify-table-deletion-logs.js
```
Result: Table created successfully with all columns and indexes.

---

### ✅ Task 2: SubmissionService.deleteSubmission Update
**File:** `backend/services/SubmissionService.js` (lines 690-830)

**Changes Made:**
1. **Added MinIO file deletion** (lines 690-710):
   - Query all files for submission
   - Delete each file using `FileService.deleteFile()`
   - Track `filesDeleted` count
   - Continue deletion even if some files fail

2. **Added child file deletion for main forms** (lines 747-769):
   - Get all child sub-form submissions
   - Delete files from each child submission
   - Track `childFilesDeleted` count

3. **Updated audit log** (line 830):
   - Added `filesDeleted` count to audit trail
   - Includes both main form and child file counts

**What It Does:**
- When deleting a submission, all associated files are removed from MinIO
- For main form submissions, files from all child sub-forms are also deleted
- Comprehensive logging of all deletions

---

### ✅ Task 3: FormService.deleteForm Update
**File:** `backend/services/FormService.js` (lines 916-1040)

**Changes Made:**
1. **Added MinIO file deletion** (lines 916-941):
   - Get all submissions for the form (main + sub-forms)
   - Delete files for each submission
   - Track `totalFilesDeleted` count

2. **Added table deletion logging** (lines 962-1040):
   - Query row count before dropping tables
   - Drop main form table
   - Log main table deletion to `table_deletion_logs`
   - Drop each sub-form table
   - Log each sub-form table deletion

**Table Deletion Log Data:**
```javascript
{
  tableName: 'form_xyz_table',
  tableType: 'main_form' | 'sub_form',
  formId: '<uuid>',
  formTitle: 'Form Title',
  subFormId: '<uuid>' (if sub-form),
  subFormTitle: 'Sub-form Title' (if sub-form),
  rowCount: 123,
  deletedBy: '<user-uuid>',
  deletedByUsername: 'username',
  deletionReason: 'Form deletion',
  backupCreated: false,
  metadata: {
    totalSubmissions: 50,
    totalFiles: 150
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ Task 4: SubFormService Creation
**File:** `backend/services/SubFormService.js` (NEW FILE - 171 lines)

**Class Structure:**
```javascript
class SubFormService {
  static async deleteSubForm(subFormId, userId) {
    // 1. Check permissions
    // 2. Delete all files from MinIO
    // 3. Drop dynamic table
    // 4. Log table deletion
    // 5. Create audit log
    // 6. Delete fields and sub-form record
  }
}
```

**Features:**
- Permission checking (form creator or admin only)
- File deletion from MinIO for all sub-form submissions
- Dynamic table deletion with row count tracking
- Table deletion logging to `table_deletion_logs`
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Transaction safety with rollback on error

## Database Schema

### table_deletion_logs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_deletion_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  table_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  table_type ENUM('main_form', 'sub_form') NOT NULL,
  form_id UUID,
  form_title VARCHAR(500),
  sub_form_id UUID,
  sub_form_title VARCHAR(500),
  row_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  deleted_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  deleted_by_username VARCHAR(100),
  deletion_reason TEXT,
  backup_created BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  backup_path VARCHAR(500),
  deleted_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,

);

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_table_deletion_logs_table_name ON table_deletion_logs(table_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_table_deletion_logs_deleted_by ON table_deletion_logs(deleted_by);
CREATE INDEX idx_table_deletion_logs_deleted_at ON table_deletion_logs(deleted_at);

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. ✅ Run migration: `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`
2. ✅ Verify table: `node backend/scripts/verify-table-deletion-logs.js`
3. ⏳ Test submission deletion (check MinIO files deleted)
4. ⏳ Test form deletion (check table dropped + logged)
5. ⏳ Test sub-form deletion (check table dropped + logged)
6. ⏳ Query `table_deletion_logs` to verify records created
7. ⏳ Test permissions (only admin/creator can delete)

### API Testing:
```bash
# Test submission deletion
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/v1/submissions/:id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Test form deletion (needs API route)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/v1/forms/:id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Test sub-form deletion (needs API route)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/v1/subforms/:id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

---

## Next Steps (TODO)

### ⏳ Task 5: API Routes (Not Started)
Create DELETE endpoints:
- `DELETE /api/v1/forms/:formId` - Delete form
- `DELETE /api/v1/subforms/:subFormId` - Delete sub-form
- Add authentication middleware
- Add authorization checks

### ⏳ Task 6: Frontend Integration (Not Started)
Add confirmation dialogs:
- Update `MainFormApp.jsx` with deletion warnings
- Show cascading deletion info (files, sub-forms, tables)
- Add "Are you sure?" confirmation modals
- Implement deletion UI in form management

### ⏳ Task 7: Documentation (Not Started)
- API documentation for DELETE endpoints
- User guide for deletion workflows
- Admin guide for table_deletion_logs queries

---
