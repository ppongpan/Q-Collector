# PDPA Phone Data Extraction Fix - Complete Verification

**Version**: v0.8.5-dev
**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED & VERIFIED

---

## 🎯 Overview

Complete enhancement of the profile rebuild system to extract and store phone numbers alongside email addresses, plus comprehensive verification scripts to ensure all submission data is properly represented in unified_user_profiles.

### Problems Solved

1. **Phone data missing from profiles** - Profiles only had email, missing phone numbers
2. **Incomplete verification** - No comprehensive check for missing data owners
3. **New submissions verification** - Need to verify specific PDPA Demo form submissions

---

## 📊 Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Missing Phone Data in Profiles

**Symptom**: All profiles showing `primary_phone = NULL` and `linked_phones = []` despite submissions containing phone fields

**Root Cause**:
- `rebuild-profiles-from-submissions.js` only extracted emails
- Phone extraction logic was completely missing
- Phone-only profile creation logic existed but never triggered (submissions always had emails)

**Impact**:
- Incomplete data owner profiles
- Missing contact information for PDPA compliance
- Dashboard showing incomplete information

---

### Issue 2: No Comprehensive Verification

**Symptom**: No systematic way to verify all submissions have corresponding profiles

**Root Cause**: Existing scripts only checked specific scenarios

**Impact**:
- Couldn't identify missing profiles systematically
- Manual database queries required
- No automated verification for data completeness

---

### Issue 3: Column Name Confusion

**Symptom**: PostgreSQL errors when querying forms and submissions tables

**Root Cause**: Schema uses camelCase (`createdAt`) but queries used snake_case (`created_at`)

**Impact**: Script failures requiring manual fixes

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Enhancement 1: Phone Data Extraction in Rebuild Script

**File**: `backend/scripts/rebuild-profiles-from-submissions.js` (lines 67-127)

**Original Code** (incomplete):
```javascript
await sequelize.query(`
  INSERT INTO unified_user_profiles (
    ...
    linked_phones,
    ...
  ) VALUES (
    ...
    '[]'::jsonb,  // ← Empty phones!
    ...
  )
`);
```

**Enhanced Code** (complete with phone extraction):
```javascript
// NEW: Get all phone numbers from these submissions
const phoneList = [];
for (const sub of submissions) {
  const [phoneData] = await sequelize.query(`
    SELECT DISTINCT sd.value_text as phone
    FROM submission_data sd
    INNER JOIN fields f ON sd.field_id = f.id
    WHERE sd.submission_id = '${sub.id}'
      AND f.type = 'phone'
      AND sd.value_text IS NOT NULL
      AND sd.value_text != ''
  `);
  phoneData.forEach(p => {
    if (!phoneList.includes(p.phone)) {
      phoneList.push(p.phone);
    }
  });
}

const primaryPhone = phoneList.length > 0 ? phoneList[0] : null;

// NEW: Create profile with phone data
await sequelize.query(`
  INSERT INTO unified_user_profiles (
    id,
    primary_email,
    primary_phone,  // ← Now populated!
    full_name,
    submission_ids,
    form_ids,
    linked_emails,
    linked_phones,  // ← Now contains actual phones!
    linked_names,
    total_submissions,
    first_submission_date,
    last_submission_date,
    match_confidence,
    created_at,
    updated_at
  ) VALUES (
    gen_random_uuid(),
    '${email}',
    ${primaryPhone ? `'${primaryPhone}'` : 'NULL'},  // ← Dynamic
    '${fullName}',
    '${JSON.stringify(submissionIds)}'::jsonb,
    '${JSON.stringify(formIds)}'::jsonb,
    '${JSON.stringify([email])}'::jsonb,
    '${JSON.stringify(phoneList)}'::jsonb,  // ← Actual phones
    '${JSON.stringify([fullName])}'::jsonb,
    ${submissions.length},
    '${firstSubmissionDate}',
    '${lastSubmissionDate}',
    1.0,
    NOW(),
    NOW()
  )
`);
```

**Key Changes**:
- Lines 67-86: Phone extraction loop for all submissions
- Line 88: Set `primaryPhone` from first phone in list
- Line 113: Added `primary_phone` column to INSERT
- Line 118: Populated `linked_phones` with actual phone array

### Enhancement 2: Comprehensive Verification Script

**File**: `backend/scripts/check-all-data-owners.js` (NEW - 169 lines)

**Purpose**: Systematically verify all submissions have corresponding profiles

**Features**:
```javascript
// Step 1: Get ALL unique emails from submissions
const [emails] = await sequelize.query(`
  SELECT
    LOWER(sd.value_text) as email,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.id) as submission_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.form_id) as form_count,
    MIN(s.submitted_at) as first_submission,
    MAX(s.submitted_at) as last_submission
  FROM submissions s
  INNER JOIN submission_data sd ON s.id = sd.submission_id
  INNER JOIN fields f ON sd.field_id = f.id
  WHERE f.type = 'email' AND sd.value_text IS NOT NULL AND sd.value_text != ''
  GROUP BY LOWER(sd.value_text)
  ORDER BY submission_count DESC
`);

// Step 2: Get ALL phones from submissions
const [phones] = await sequelize.query(`
  SELECT
    sd.value_text as phone,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.id) as submission_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.form_id) as form_count
  FROM submissions s
  INNER JOIN submission_data sd ON s.id = sd.submission_id
  INNER JOIN fields f ON sd.field_id = f.id
  WHERE f.type = 'phone' AND sd.value_text IS NOT NULL AND sd.value_text != ''
  GROUP BY sd.value_text
  ORDER BY submission_count DESC
`);

// Step 3: Get ALL profiles
const [profiles] = await sequelize.query(`
  SELECT
    primary_email,
    primary_phone,
    full_name,
    jsonb_array_length(form_ids) as form_count,
    jsonb_array_length(submission_ids) as submission_count,
    created_at
  FROM unified_user_profiles
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
`);

// Step 4: Find MISSING emails
const [missingEmails] = await sequelize.query(`
  SELECT DISTINCT LOWER(sd.value_text) as email
  FROM submissions s
  INNER JOIN submission_data sd ON s.id = sd.submission_id
  INNER JOIN fields f ON sd.field_id = f.id
  WHERE f.type = 'email'
    AND sd.value_text IS NOT NULL
    AND sd.value_text != ''
    AND LOWER(sd.value_text) NOT IN (
      SELECT LOWER(primary_email) FROM unified_user_profiles WHERE primary_email IS NOT NULL
    )
`);

// Step 5: Find MISSING phones
const [missingPhones] = await sequelize.query(`
  SELECT DISTINCT sd.value_text as phone
  FROM submissions s
  INNER JOIN submission_data sd ON s.id = sd.submission_id
  INNER JOIN fields f ON sd.field_id = f.id
  WHERE f.type = 'phone'
    AND sd.value_text IS NOT NULL
    AND sd.value_text != ''
    AND sd.value_text NOT IN (
      SELECT primary_phone FROM unified_user_profiles WHERE primary_phone IS NOT NULL
    )
`);
```

**Output Format**:
```
📊 SUMMARY:
===========
Unique emails in submissions: 5
Unique phones in submissions: 5
Total unique data owners expected: 10
Profiles in unified_user_profiles: 5
Missing emails: 0
Missing phones: 0

✅ All data owners are synced!
```

### Enhancement 3: Specific Form Verification Script

**File**: `backend/scripts/check-new-submissions.js` (NEW - 174 lines)

**Purpose**: Verify specific PDPA Demo form submissions have profiles

**Features**:
```javascript
// Find PDPA Demo forms
const [forms] = await sequelize.query(`
  SELECT id, title, "createdAt"
  FROM forms
  WHERE title LIKE '%PDPA - Demo%'
  ORDER BY "createdAt" DESC
  LIMIT 5
`);

// Get latest submissions for target form
const [submissions] = await sequelize.query(`
  SELECT
    s.id,
    s.form_id,
    s.submitted_at,
    s."createdAt"
  FROM submissions s
  WHERE s.form_id = '${targetForm.id}'
  ORDER BY s."createdAt" DESC
  LIMIT 10
`);

// For each submission, check if profile exists
for (const sub of submissions) {
  // Get email from submission
  const [emails] = await sequelize.query(`
    SELECT sd.value_text as email
    FROM submission_data sd
    INNER JOIN fields f ON sd.field_id = f.id
    WHERE sd.submission_id = '${sub.id}'
      AND f.type = 'email'
      AND sd.value_text IS NOT NULL
      AND sd.value_text != ''
  `);

  // Check if profile exists
  const [profile] = await sequelize.query(`
    SELECT id, primary_email, primary_phone
    FROM unified_user_profiles
    WHERE LOWER(primary_email) = LOWER('${emails[0].email}')
  `);

  if (profile.length > 0) {
    console.log(`  ✅ Profile exists: ${profile[0].id}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`  ❌ Profile NOT found for this email!`);
    missingProfiles.push({...});
  }
}
```

**Output Format**:

## 🔍 Database Verification Queries

### Check Profile Completeness
```sql
SELECT
  primary_email,
  primary_phone,
  full_name,
  jsonb_array_length(linked_phones) as phone_count,
  jsonb_array_length(submission_ids) as submission_count,
  jsonb_array_length(form_ids) as form_count
FROM unified_user_profiles
ORDER BY created_at;
```

**Expected Result** (5 rows):
- chanchai.mankhong@example.com | 081-234-5678 | 1 phone | 2 submissions | 1 form
- prasert.wittayakorn@example.com | 082-345-6789 | 1 phone | 4 submissions | 1 form
- somchai.jaidee@example.com | 083-456-7890 | 1 phone | 13 submissions | 5 forms
- somying.raksaad@example.com | 084-567-8901 | 1 phone | 2 submissions | 1 form
- wilai.sukchai@example.com | 085-678-9012 | 1 phone | 1 submission | 1 form

### Check for NULL Phones
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as null_phone_count
FROM unified_user_profiles
WHERE primary_phone IS NULL;
```

**Expected Result**: `0` (no NULL phones)

### Verify Phone Data Match
```sql
SELECT
  uup.primary_email,
  uup.primary_phone,
  uup.linked_phones
FROM unified_user_profiles uup
ORDER BY uup.created_at;
```

**Expected**: All `linked_phones` arrays contain at least one phone number

## 🔮 Future Maintenance

### When to Run Verification Scripts

**Scenario 1: After bulk data import**
```bash
node backend/scripts/check-all-data-owners.js
```

**Scenario 2: User reports missing profile**
```bash
node backend/scripts/check-new-submissions.js
```

**Scenario 3: Data integrity audit**
```bash
# Run all verification scripts
node backend/scripts/check-all-data-owners.js
node backend/scripts/check-new-submissions.js
```

### When to Run Rebuild Script

**Scenario 1: Phone data found to be missing**
```bash
node backend/scripts/rebuild-profiles-from-submissions.js
```

**Scenario 2: Profile data out of sync**
```bash
# First verify the issue
node backend/scripts/check-all-data-owners.js

# Then rebuild if needed
node backend/scripts/rebuild-profiles-from-submissions.js

# Finally verify fix
node backend/scripts/check-all-data-owners.js
```

**Scenario 3: Major data migration**
```bash
# Backup first
pg_dump qcollector_dev_2025 > backup_before_rebuild.sql

# Run rebuild
node backend/scripts/rebuild-profiles-from-submissions.js

# Verify
node backend/scripts/check-all-data-owners.js
```
